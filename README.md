# 3D Dungeon Environment Model

## Overview
This repository features a meticulously crafted low-poly 3D dungeon environment, designed in Blender to deliver an atmospheric and immersive setting for games, animations, and virtual experiences. The model is built with modular components, allowing for flexible customization and easy integration into various projects. 

The dungeon environment includes a variety of detailed assets such as wooden crates, barrels, wall-mounted torches emitting realistic lighting, robust stone pillars, and modular walls and floors. Each element is optimized for a low-poly aesthetic, balancing visual appeal and performance. This makes the model ideal for real-time applications, especially in low-resource scenarios like mobile or indie game development.

Whether youâ€™re building an RPG, fantasy game, or simply need an evocative dungeon setting, this environment provides the foundational elements to bring your vision to life. With attention to lighting, shadow, and spatial composition, this dungeon model offers both style and functionality in a low-poly format.
